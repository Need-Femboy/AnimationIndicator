# Animation Indicator
Inspired by https://www.infernotrainer.com/, lights up an NPC once its animation changes.<br>
Will NOT indicate if you prayed correctly against the monster.<br>
It should also be noted that this plugin will not work for certain NPCs due to Runelite restrictions, including but not limited to:<br>
Verzik Vitur, Alchemical Hydra, and JalTok-Jad
